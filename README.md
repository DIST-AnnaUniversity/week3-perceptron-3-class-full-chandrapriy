# perceptron-3-class-full
<ol>

<li>This is in continuation of last class exercise. 

<li>Create a file with name three_c_perceptron.py. Within that have two functions with name multiple_iterations() and check_new(weight). 

<li>The function with name multiple_iterations() should return the value of weights after 4 or 5 iterations. 

<li>The function with name check_new(weight) should return the output values for the new input values, y_new = np.array([[11,3,1],[2,-6,1],[-6,6,1],]). Make sure you pass the final weight obtained from the function multiple_iterations() as an argument to this function.

<li>Once you push the code, your code will be checked and a tick mark will appear indicating your code is correct.
</ol>
